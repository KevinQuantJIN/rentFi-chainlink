Question 1.
I am currently preparing a Chainlink Hackathon and wants to provide my product named rentFi. Now I need you to assist me to review the product features.
Character: 3 character in the system, the landlord, the tenant and the investor.
Landlord Function:
a. Initialize a tenancy smart contract with the detail of the property.
b. If the tenancy smart contract is signed by the tenant, the landlord can do:
1. withdraw the unpaid rent from the depoist stake in the smart contract
2. End the rental with the tenant and get part of the guarantee back to makeup the loss due to property demage.
c. Mint the tenancy smart contract as an NFT and sell it in the marketplace, the person who buy it will get all the rent paid during the lease.
Tenant Function:
a. Sign (Sign and pay first month rent and deposit and guarantee) to enter the tenancy smart contract that Initialize by the landlord
b. Pay the rent through ERC 20 token using smart contract
Investor Function:
a. Auction the NFT in the marketplace and get the rent cash flow through smart contract if they owned the NFT

Question 2.
I have currently finish developing the basic function about renting. Here is the code, you can review my code and tell me where to start first, I am considering the 3 following start point:
1. Link lending service to the guarantee and deposit in the smart contract and return the profit to the tenant
2. Build a NFT market place first
3. Your suggestion
